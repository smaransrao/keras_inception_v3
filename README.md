# keras_inception_v3
Image classification using keras inception v3 model for custom images

This code is a template for classifying 10 different categories of grayscale images using python's Keras library. The neural network used for the classification is based on the inception v3 model. The network is modified with additional layers to work with grayscale images and a custom number of output classes.

Author's Note:
The code available here is custom written, after experimenting and looking at a lot of documentation. When I wanted to write code for image classification using keras for my own grayscale images, I did not find a simple direct code. I have written my own functions to load images and assign labels to images which can be used instead of the inbuilt function keras provides which is for inbuilt databases only and not custom images. I hope this code is useful to anyone who like me wants to classify their own images using keras.
